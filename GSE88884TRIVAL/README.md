GSE88884TRIVAL
This folder documents our complete workflow and analyses conducted on the GSE88884 dataset.

At the beginning of the project, we extensively explored the GSE88884 dataset and conducted various modeling attempts, including data cleaning, feature selection, and the training and evaluation of multiple models. However, after multiple rounds of experiments, we found that the modeling performance based on this dataset did not meet our expectations, and the analysis results were unsatisfactory.

As a result, our team decided to switch to a new dataset for subsequent modeling and analysis.
This folder retains all experimental processes, codes, and intermediate results related to GSE88884, serving as a full record of our exploratory work for future reference and review.
