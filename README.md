# üß¨ Data Cleaning - GSE88884 SLE Dataset

This branch contains the **data preprocessing and cleaning steps** for our biomedical project using the GSE88884 dataset.

---

## üìÑ Overview

We processed and cleaned the following datasets:

1. **Gene Expression Data**  
   Pre-processed microarray gene expression matrix, filtered and matched to clinical samples.

2. **Phenotypic (Clinical) Data**  
   Metadata including age, sex, race, complement levels, anti-dsDNA antibody status, and SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores.
