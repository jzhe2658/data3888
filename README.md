# DATA3888
This project uses gene expression and clinical data from the GSE88884 study to explore biomarkers and develop a risk prediction model for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **data/**: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- **scripts/**: R code files for data cleaning, analysis, and modelling.
- **results/**: Output files (plots, tables).
- **shiny_app/**: Optional folder for future deployment of interactive risk calculator.

## ðŸš€ How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourGithub...

```

Start from data-cleaning branch

Cleaned datasets are saved in data/expr_df_matched.rds and data/pheno_clean.rds

Future analysis should load these .rds files to ensure consistency

Each contributor should work in a separate branch and merge to main once reviewed
